# fish_count

# Overview
null - weather temp does not affect monthly fish catch 
Supervised machine learning model
    - dependent variable: fish counts

Notes:
Based on weather conditions in a 4 months prior we can predict the count with a 95% accuracy.

Other variables: 
- hatcheries
- ocean weather conditions
